        I'm a Software Engineering undergrad at UCI with a passion for
        full-stack and backend development. I'm a builder, leader, and
        technologist who loves solving real-world problems, whether it's
        creating virtual versions of physical systems, building tools that
        improve AI interactions, or designing secure and efficient APIs.

      <p className="text-lg pt-3 max-w-2xl">
        I move fast, think things through, and care deeply about the impact of
        what I create. Every project I work on is an opportunity to push
        boundaries, ship smart solutions, and make something meaningful.
